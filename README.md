Structural properties and activation of the cerebral cortex are typically studied with reference to a brain atlas and previously found robust networks. In particular, many studies have first 
performed statistical testing over the regions of the used brain atlas, and then interpreted the statistically significant findings with respect to known brain networks. However, the status quo 
appears to be to perform such judgments only qualitatively. Here we present statistical tests for assessing whether findings defined over the regions of a brain atlas conform to previously 
found brain networks.

Note that the related problem of assessing agreement between two atlas-based results has been recently discussed by Alexander-Bloch and colleagues (2018).
